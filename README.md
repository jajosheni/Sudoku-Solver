# Sudoku-Solver
#### This is a sudoku solver written in c# (console app)
It works by using a simple logic based on techniques such as:
```
1. Line scanning
2. Column scanning
3. Square scanning
```

Works extremely fast (*much faster than recursive functions*). but the solution is not always guaranted.
It could work flawlessly by implementing other ways of possibility creation techniques such as:
```
1. X Wing
2. Naked Pair
3. Naked Triple
etc..
```

# Sudoku-Solver
#### This is a sudoku solver written in c# (console app)
It works by using a simple logic based on techniques such as:
```
1. Line possibilities
2. Column possibilities
3. Square possibilities
```

Works extremely fast (*much faster than recursive functions*). but the solution is not always guaranted.
It could work flawlessly by implementing other ways of possibility creation techniques such as:
```
1. X Wing
```
